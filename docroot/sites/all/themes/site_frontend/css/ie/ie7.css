/**
 * box-sizing: border-box does not work in IE7 and needs a polyfill, but the polyfill was
 * having no effect on IE7 and this was breaking the grid layout. It turns out that
 * we needed to override the path for "behavior" for the boxsizing polyfill to work in IE7
 * compass toolkit/box-sizing does implement this below but not correctly,
 * see https://github.com/Team-Sass/toolkit/issues/19 and https://drupal.org/node/2102959
