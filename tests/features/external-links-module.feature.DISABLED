Feature: External links module
  I want to be able to use external link feature
  As an editor user
  So I can change the href

  Background:
    Given I log in as an existing "admin"

  @javascript
  Scenario: External links within fields
    Given I am on "/node/add/document-page"
    And I should see "Create General Page" in the "Page Title" region
    When I fill in "edit-title" with "test"
    And I fill in "edit-field-title-short-und-0-value" with "test"

    And I press "edit-submit" in the "Submit" region
    Then I should see "General Page test has been created."
    And I should see "Example.com"
    And the response should contain "ext"
