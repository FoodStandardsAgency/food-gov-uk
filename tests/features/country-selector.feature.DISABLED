Feature: Country selector
  I want to switch seamlessly between Welsh & English language versions of any public page
  As a Welsh User
  So I can read it in my prefered language

  Scenario:
    Given I am on "/wales/english-test"
    And the response should contain "lang=\"en\""
    And I should see "Cymraeg"
    When I click "Cymraeg"
    Then I should be on "/wales/welsh-test"
    And the response should contain "lang=\"cy\""
