Feature: Committee
 I want to view a different style for sub-sites
 As a user
 So I can tell if I am on a sub-site

  Scenario: COT - sub-theme
   Given I am on "/committee/committee-on-toxicity"
   Then the response should contain ""
   
   
   #We need to have some way of identifying that the page is using the sub theme via the html response of the page.
   #something similar to what we did for the user login.
