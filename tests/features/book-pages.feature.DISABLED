Feature: Book pages
  I want to be able to create a set of related pages that are linked to each other
  As a Content Editor
  So I can add content that is very closely related, like a set of regulations

  Scenario: Create parent book page
    Given I log in as an existing "editor"
    And I am on "/node/add/document-page"
    When I fill in "edit-title" with "parent book page"
    And I fill in "edit-field-title-short-und-0-value" with "test"
    And I check the box "N/A" in "edit-field-site-section-und"
    And I click "Menu settings"
    And I select "About us" from "edit-menu-parent-hierarchical-select-selects-1"
    And I click "Page settings"
    And I click "Book"
    And I check the box "edit-field-book-base-page-und"
    And I press "edit-submit" in the "Submit" region
    Then I should see "General Page parent book page has been created."
    And I should see "parent book page" in the "Book page title" region

  Scenario: Create child book page
    Given I log in as an existing "editor"
    And I am on "/node/add/document-page"
    When I fill in "edit-title" with "child book page"
    And I fill in "edit-field-title-short-und-0-value" with "test"
    And I check the box "N/A" in "edit-field-site-section-und"
    And I click "Menu settings"
    And I select "About us" from "edit-menu-parent-hierarchical-select-selects-1"
    And I click "Page settings"
    And I click "Book"
    And I fill in "edit-field-book-section-und-0-value" with "section 1"
    And I click "edit-field-book-parent-und-add-more"
    And I press "edit-submit" in the "Submit" region
    Then I should see "General Page parent book page has been created."

  Scenario: Verify book pages are linked correctly
    Given I am on "/about-us/child-book-page"
    Then I should see "parent book page" in the "Book parent title" region
    And I should see "section 1" in the "Book section title" region
    And I should see "child book page" in the "Book page title" region
