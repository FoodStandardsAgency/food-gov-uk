Feature: Custom input filter
  As a Content Editor
  I want to be able to use some html markup in my text
  So I can have some control over the formatting of content

  Scenario: Creating content with custom input filter
    Given I log in as an existing "editor"
    And I go to "/node/add/document-page"
    And I should see "Create General Page" in the "Page Title" region
    When I fill in "edit-title" with "test"
    And I fill in "edit-field-title-short-und-0-value" with "test"
    And I click "Body"
    And I select "Preserve" from "edit-body-und-0-format--2"
    And I fill in "edit-body-und-0-value" with:
    """
    Test 1: This text should be in it's own paragraph, check it's wrapped in paragraph tags.

    Test 2:This text has line break spacing so that the next line starts
    here, check there is a break tag dividing these two lines.

    <p>Test 3: Check this text has paragraph tag on it.<br />Also a break tag</p>

  <!-- preserve start -->
   Test 4: Check this text ignores the line break and there is no break tag,
   this should be on the same line, and so should the rest of this test.

   Check this is on the same line, not a separate paragraph.
    <!-- preserve end -->

    And I check the box "N/A" in "edit-field-site-section-und"
    And I press "edit-submit" in the "Submit" region
    Then the response should contain the docstring
