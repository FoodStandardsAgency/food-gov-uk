Feature: Final research report
  I want to be directed to further information/content on non-FSA sites about the topic I am currently viewing
  As a User
  So I can more deeply explore the topics I'm interested in without having to search around

  @javascript
  Scenario: Final research report block
    Given I log in as an existing "editor"
    And I am on "/node/add/document-page"
    And I should see "Create General Page" in the "Page Title" region
    When I fill in "edit-title" with "test Final research report"
    And I fill in "edit-field-title-short-und-0-value" with "test"
    And I check the box "N/A" in "edit-field-site-section-und"
    And I click "Right hand column"
    And I press the "Add existing node" button
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    And I fill in "edit-field-links-external-und-form-entity-id" with "Final report"
    #Down key entered twice to trigger auto-complete, wait needed.
    And I press the "down" key in the "edit-field-links-external-und-form-entity-id" field
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    And I press the "down" key in the "edit-field-links-external-und-form-entity-id" field
    And I press the "enter" key in the "edit-field-links-external-und-form-entity-id" field
    And I press "edit-submit" in the "Submit" region
    Then I should see "General Page test Final research report has been created."
    And I should see the text "Final research report" in the "Final research report block" region
